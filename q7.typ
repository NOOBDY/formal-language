7. Which of the following languages are regular? Justify each answer.

  + $L = {w c w | w in {a, b}^ast}$.

    Not regular, proof:

    Let $|w| = p, w = x y, c w = z$, $|x y^i| != |w| "if" i > 1$.

  + $L = {x y | x, y in {a, b}^ast "and" |x| = |y|}$.
  
    Not regular, proof:

    Let $L$ be a regular language,

  + $L = {a^n | n "is a prime number"}$.

  + $L = {a^m b^n | gcd(m, n) = 17}$.
